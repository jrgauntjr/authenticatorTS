## Overview

**Project Title**: Authenticator

**Project Description**: An authenticator to login in and manage your account, with ability to create a new user

**Project Goals**: To learn TypeScript and to be able to make a small project 

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. In the terminal type ```tsc``` to compile in the authenticatorTS folder
2. Once compiled, type ```node dist/app.js``` to run

Instructions for using the software:

1. Create however many users you would like
2. Login with a username and password
3. Once authenticated, you can either delete the account or log out

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code
* node.js and TypeScript
* @types/node library to get the readline module

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Readline documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)
* [How to set up a new TypeScript Project](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/typescript-new-project)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Saving the users to a file to be able to login after exiting the program
* [ ] Include encryption like bcrpyt to protect usernames and passwords
* [ ] Give ability for the user to see their ID
* [ ] Update the structure of the code to be more applicable to adapt to other systems
